\section{Conclusion}
\label{ch:Conclusion}

As seen, updating a devices sources to the latest Android revision is not easy, consumes quite a bit of time, could be frustrating at times and might not always end up working 100\%.
However, the advantages of being protected from the latest security risks while not being required to buy a new device while the old one is perfectly fine for someones needs,
and therefore being able to counter planned obsolescence do, to me and many others, outweight these disadvantages and are worth the effort.

Paired with the postive feedback and happiness you're faced with as a developer, this project as well as the custom ROM scene is just a lot of fun.

I'd like to thank Arian\footnote{https://github.com/ArianK16a}, Max Weffers\footnote{https://github.com/rcstar6696} and Nikhil Punathil\footnote{https://github.com/drakonizer} as well as everyone else from the \gls{gls:carbon}\footnote{https://github.com/CarbonROM} team for their help when it was needed.
